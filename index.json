[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"How can we build computer vision models that can handle the complexity of the world? We find that current models have a hard time generalizing beyond their training categories, dealing with image corruptions, handling clutter and tend to use shortcuts like using texture instead of shape. If we really want to build machines that don\u0026rsquo;t discriminate, are safe to use, understand our intentions and work beyond simplified environments like assembly lines we will have to understand their failures and learn how to fix them making sure that our fixes really solve the problems and don\u0026rsquo;t just cover them up.\nBefore becoming a PhD student in the labs of Matthias Bethge and Alexander Ecker I studied Physics in Konstanz. I there headed the student union and represented the students in the university senate, two experiences that required me to learn a completely new skillset including public speeking, project and organization management as well as hiring and supervising emloyees. Taking these commitments comes from a deep conviction that most things can be organized in a way that profits everyone.\nBeyond studying and work I am interested in arts and culture as well as a number of sports including slacklining, climbing, mountainbiking, sailing and hiking. These interests lead me to a number of great experiences including organzing the 2015 Baden-Württemberg Poetry Slam Championship, founding the Konstanz Slackline Association, working as a sailing teacher, accompanying extreme swimmers as skipper and two stays in South America for travelling and voluntary work.\n","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"72ec293cd4d51f60de7fac6e44671dd0","permalink":"https://michaelisc.github.io/authors/claudio/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/claudio/","section":"authors","summary":"How can we build computer vision models that can handle the complexity of the world?

This can be realized by paying a small fee of 1.30 EUR per student per semester to both institutions and includes any event including premieres. Students simply have to show up at the cashier an hour before the event and will get the best remaining tickets for free. Additionally the Zebra Kino, KULA and many other places regularly offer reduced prices or free entries subsidized through the ticket.\nMaking this ticket a reality was probably the highlight of my carrer as a student representative. For the price of 2 beers over a whole bachelors students can visit concerts and plays for free. I myself used this offering a lot and I hope it will give first semesters a feeling of being welome in the city.\n","date":1596924000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596924000,"objectID":"3899c1958dbf03a423666b15873d57a5","permalink":"https://michaelisc.github.io/project/kulturticket/","publishdate":"2020-08-09T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/kulturticket/","section":"project","summary":"Free entry to theatre and concerts for all students in Konstanz.","tags":["student-representation","voluntary-work"],"title":"Kulturticket Konstanz","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"About the project:\nWe are building a low cost drone specially designed to support Search And Rescue (SAR) missions on the sea.\nAt the moment the main usage scenario is to support the rescue missions in the mediterran sea: private rescue organisations like Sea-Watch e.V., Sea-Eye e.V. or ResQship e.V. conduct civil search and rescue operations.
